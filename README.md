# Project title

Fancy Tools

## Getting Started
This project will be helpful for git users. There are aliases that are created to simplifies the git commands. The aliases created are:
1) gss = git status
2) gap = git add
3) gpl = git pull
4) gpu = git push
There is also a function called gco which also works like an alias. The function gco is a pseudonym of git commit. It will actually send your message but will also include the branch you are at. 
### Prerequisites

You only need to download the zip file and extract it onto your computer. You can also clone the git repository on your terminal.

### Installing

Firstly you need to open your terminal and write down the pathway to the fancytools folder. Then from there you can execute the file install.sh by using this code : ./install.sh

note:*Sometimes you need to give the file executable rights for it to be able to install on your pc, the code to fix that is :chmod +x install.sh*
